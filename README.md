# CS50W Final Project 
In this project, I developed a web application called "ART+".This application is a platform where articles on different branches of art can be uploaded.The articles uploaded in this application remain live for two weeks. If you want to access these articles later, you should like these articles.I wanted to develop an easy-to-examine, uncomplicated web application for anyone interested in art. With this application, it is aimed to give an idea to people in general thanks to the short and concise articles.

In this web application Django, Javascript and Bootstrap, were used and web application is mobile-responsive.
In the distribution code is a Django project called capstone that contains a single app called blog.

#### What makes this project more complex than the others?
In this project, in addition to the other projects I developed during the course, I focused on the front-end part.I tried to develop a web application that provides a more aesthetic look and a better user experience.I wanted to develop an application that is simple but does not skip any required content.
It is the first application I designed as mobile responsive.

### How to run this web application 
It must first be installed  python and django on your computer
Run "python manage.py runserver" in your terminal to start up the Django web server, and visit the website in your browser.
